# Liminale

This is a small project aimed at algorithmically generating music for meditation or background listening. While I do not focus on utilizing any particular frequencies, synthesizing audio from code allows me to work with exact frequency ratios without the need for any tuning system. This project is as much a joke as it is a sincere exploration of music outside my usual habits, as well as a fun coding exercise.

For liminale I am using the [CLM](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/clm/) library for synthesis and my own [layers-utils](https://github.com/Leon-Focker/layers-utils) library.
